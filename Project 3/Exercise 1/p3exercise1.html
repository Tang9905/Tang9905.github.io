  reading response<br>
  I read the article called "the internet's original sin ".This article is surely inspiritaional as I revealed the downside of the current busniness model held by most internet companies.
  The thing I found especially interesting is how a web using ads or content decided by the algorithm can hurt the both the viewers and the comapny.
  And the point that is even more amazing is when the writier mentioned the business model of the website that needs to be paid for viewing. How his
  explenation of this model made me change my mind from thinking it is a horrible idea to believe in him.<br>

<p>
  interesting question<br>
  how would a paid-website be like in the near future.

<p>
  ideas<br>
  idea1: as the goal of creating a paid-website is to provide uw with a healthy website environment, the website must be insightful and full of meaningful content that users would be willing
  to pay for. I think the problem of the algorithm used by the websites today is that now all the users want the content that is delicately "designed" by the tech companies, and it's also
  better for the users themselves to receive the web info with a larger variety. And the randomn content would be a perfect solution for this as it won't particularly fit the users' taste.
  And what my webpage should do is to make sure that even the content is random, it is still the content that worths to be read.<br>
  idea2: my second idea is to build a website that reveals how the money donated by the users are used by the company. And also, the website should not only reveal, but in some way encourage
  the users to support the website more than they used to do. Like there can be different demands for funds listed on the webpage, there can be different proposals and wireframes of different
  projects or content listed on the webpage. And make it more convenient for the users to decide weather they would donate, and how much they are goona donate to the website.
