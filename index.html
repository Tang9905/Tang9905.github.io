  <h4>But are we missingsomething here?  What are we exchanging for efficiency?</h4> <h3>In many apps, the votes we cast — 
  the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts — are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status
  than to the substance of what’s posted. </h3><h2>A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left
  outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.</h2>
  <h1>And not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, they also tend
  to show us more of what we’ve already liked.</h1><h1>These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor
  our news feeds with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.</h1>
